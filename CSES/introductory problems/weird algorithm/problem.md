# Weird algorithm

Consider an algorithm that takes as input a positive integer n. If n is even, the algorithm divides it by two, and if n is odd, the algorithm multiplies it by three and adds one. The algorithm repeats this, until n is one. For example, the sequence for n=3 is as follows: 

3→10→5→16→8→4→2→1

Your task is to simulate the execution of the algorithm for a given value of n.

## input
The only input line contains an integer n

## output
Print a line that contains all values of n during the algorithm.

## constraints
**1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6**

## example

input: 3 

outupt: 3 10 5 16 8 4 2 1
